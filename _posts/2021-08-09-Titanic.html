[Titanic - Project](https://github.com/flaakira/Kaggle/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb)


- [x] This is the legendary Titanic ML competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), This project I used machine learning to predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. My model had a 75% accurancy rate.
