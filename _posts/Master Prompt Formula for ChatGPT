Master Prompt Formula for ChatGPT
This document outlines a structured approach to crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT using
a six-word formula: Persona, Context, Task, Format, Exemplar, and Tone. By following this
formula, users can enhance the quality of interactions with the AI, ensuring that responses are
tailored to specific needs and expectations.
Persona
Define the character or role that ChatGPT should embody. This could be a professional, a
casual friend, or an expert in a specific field. Establishing a clear persona helps set the stage
for the interaction.
Context
Provide background information relevant to the conversation. This includes any necessary
details that will help ChatGPT understand the situation or topic at hand. Context is crucial for
generating accurate and relevant responses.
Task
Clearly state what you want ChatGPT to do. Whether it's answering a question, providing a
summary, or generating creative content, specifying the task ensures that the AI focuses on
the desired outcome.
Format
Indicate the preferred format for the response. This could be a list, a paragraph, a dialogue,
or any other structure that suits your needs. Specifying the format helps in organizing the
information effectively.
Exemplar
Offer an example of what you are looking for. This could be a sample response or a specific
style that you want ChatGPT to emulate. Providing an exemplar can guide the AI in producing
outputs that align with your expectations.
Tone
Describe the desired tone of the response. Whether you want it to be formal, informal,
humorous, or serious, specifying the tone helps in shaping the overall feel of the interaction.
By utilizing this six-word formula, users can create prompts that lead to more engaging and
