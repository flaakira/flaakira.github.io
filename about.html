<p>My name is Flavio Akira. I am a Data Analyst student at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology - SAIT, HR/ IT Data Analyst Summer student
  and bachelor in Economics.</p> <br>

<p>I strongly believe that using data-driven we can help businesses to move forward.</p> <br>

<p>Once you put together ideas and knowing the correct questions to be made as â€“ what I really need? How can I improve? what Can I change? and etc. 
  You are able to capture data accurately and prepare an analysis. Resulting in a clean, organized, and understandable data presentation.</p> 

<p>In 2017, I have moved to Canada. Looking for a fresh and new starting, I have engaged myself in the data world, and now, after setting up in Calgary. 
  I felt the motivation needed to explore and learn more about Data Analysis.</p>
