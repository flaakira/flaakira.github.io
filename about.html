<p>I strongly believe that using data-driven we can help businesses to move forward.</p>

<p>Once you put together ideas and knowing the correct questions to be made as â€“ what I really need? How can I improve? what Can I change? and etc. 
  You are able to capture data accurately and prepare an analysis. Resulting in a clean, organized, and understandable data presentation.</p> 

<p>In 2017, I have moved to Canada. Looking for a fresh and new starting, I have engaged myself in the data world, and now, after setting up in Calgary. 
  I felt the motivation needed to explore and learn more about Data Analysis.</p>
